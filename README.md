# 🎬 IMDb Sentiment Analysis App | Dockerized End-to-End ML Project

<p align="center">

🚀 FastAPI • Streamlit • Scikit-learn • Docker • MLOps Mini Project

</p>

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a movie review is:

✅ Positive  
❌ Negative

It combines:

- 🧠 Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF)
- ⚡ FastAPI backend for inference
- 🎨 Streamlit frontend for interactive analysis
- 🐳 Dockerized multi-container deployment with Docker Compose

Supports:

✔ Single Review Prediction  
✔ Bulk Review Analysis  
✔ Confidence Scoring  
✔ Aggregate Sentiment Summary

# 🛠 How I Built This

--- Built an NLP preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing text data  
- Trained a sentiment classification model using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression  
- Developed a FastAPI backend to serve model predictions  
- Created a Streamlit frontend for interactive user analysis  
- Containerized the full application using Docker and Docker Compose---

# 🚧 Key Challenges

- Environment setup and dependency configuration  
- Integrating ML model, API, frontend, and containers  
- Multi-container Docker orchestration  
- Debugging runtime and communication issues  
- Iterative testing and deployment refinement
